What was your favorite subject in school?
What was your childhood nickname?

 1 Do more work on the login, forgot password                                                             
  2 The login function does not work, and the forgot password
  3 page; I have not even started yet. I will probably email the owner
  4 and wait 24 hours then produce the 2 questions required to change
  5 the password. If the link in the email is answered it must be from the
  6 same IP address as either whitelisted or the same IP as the one who
  7 initiated the forgot password process. The page the email link is linked
  8 to will only work if it is answered within 24 hours but will ask the
  9 security questions and will reveal the complete real email address. If
 10 the person does not know the security questions it will be indicated in
 11 the first email and they must answer most IRC related questions such as 
 12 nickname passwords, channel passwords if htat is not possible then the
 13 usernames main nickname, Home channel and a log file either from a Query
 14 (hopefully) or from a channel text the text must be completed (time
 15 stamps may also be needed (TS IS NOT NEEDED) to be answered if no query text exists. If the
 16 person has never logged on to IRC nor Gambled yet then the email address maybe
 17 changed and the old password will be sent to the email with a link the change the
    password and a link to the login page. If the login goes 7 days without gamble or IRC
    then the account is dropped and all the user's data is erased.
