Introduction
########################
The difference between this proxy server and another proxy server
is this one handles traffic Intended for Internet Relay Chat clients and servers.
Trio-Ircproxy.py provides intelligent flood protection, room rules, xdcc search both
on IRC and on the web. A casino which can be played on the web or on IRC; it is very 
simple, yet fun. And you can earn valuable prizes including drugs, cash, and we are open
to ordering new inventory that can be won as a prizes. The most expensive game is $2 
and the inexpensive games are 5 cents. You can still win big on the 5 cent games. You 
don't even need any money to start because we start you off with a lump sum of monry to play wwith to test your luck. I wish you best of luck while using Trio-Ircproxy.py. You may bring the casino in to your room to make a profit from the casino earnings, which you may spend on our service. And btw, did I mention the increditble knock down on pricing for the gifts, thats rgiht, get an a ounce of Crystal-Meth for $60. And remember, stay safe.

User Pages
######################
User pages are web-pages on the www.MyProxyIP.com/user/<username> web-site
where stats are kept about the user such as /whois information but over a larger period of time.
You may keep private logs if up to 5000 lines per chat room or private.
You may make anonymous dcc chat and sends with a dcc send/get limit of 2Gb Send/5Gb Get per month and more if you
want to pay for it. Here at MyProxyIP.com we have ways of making you money, $300 can change your life.
You can turn that in to $1,000 in just few days delivery time. And even larger gains if you have more
money you can earn up to 12k. No saying its legit, not saying its not-legit. But playing at this casino the game for
prizes only you can win some wicked shit for 1/3rd the street cost. This is because you have to spend money and
play your luck.


Channel Protection
##############################
Flood protection works by counting how many ctcp-replies (for example) you have received
within a specific amount of time and if it is over the hardcoded limit
then ctco-replies will be ignored. Unless of course you have sent a ctcp
to a channel and are expecting a large amount of replies. Then just replies
per person is counted and if it is over that limit ctcp-replies are ignored
for that person. If too many people send
too many replies then all ctcp-replies will be ignored by not sending to the client.
This will prevent the client from slowing down too much, scripts cannot compete in speed with a well debugged Python3
app.
In all cases where a script would be used Trio-ircproxy.py steps in to prevent a laggy client from a
performance decrease trying to run scripts which may appear to be fast but it is just an illusion of UX performance
tricks. And other scripts are just as slow so there is no real comparison to what speed is like in the IRC world.
Flood protection includes excess invalid (unknown) ctcps and replies.
Flooding with non ascii characters in channels where ascii is mostly used
or assumed. Or just common text/notice/action floods, either private or in channel.
Topic change flood, mode change floods (no mode lock scripts allowed, because
they fight server and chanserv (or X bot), and part of floodING a channel is getting it on the netsplit
and flooding deop, ban, topic, and mode changes on the split server where they can gain ops in to room because everyone
else is on the other side of the netsplit.
A Trio-Ircproxy.py user may request assistance from the proxy hive which can have the channel
Founder password, or at least a high access level to remove Successor, Managers, Sops, Aops, etc. who are
mass-deopping, mass-kicking, kicking, banning, modifying akick/access list or changing Successor from
legit users. It helps with sudden modification to the aop/sop/manager list, also removes the attacking offensive people
from the ACCESS list quickly. It also helps where ever passwords get leaked. If you request intervention from an IRC Operator
and he sees the channel is in chaos he is going to lock the channel down and close it preventing anybody
from joining in permanently. So, by sharing the channel password with the proxy hive users can be
punished accordingly by removing access and banning their hostname from being added to the access
list in any channel where Trio-Ircproxy.py is watching out for. If a person using ZNC is being refused
access to a channel I would suggest to them to use Trio-Ircproxy.py which prevents
abuse at tts root, and even an abusive person would find it difficult to attack a channel using this proxy.
Any time a password is used, after that the password maybe used by msg'ing @pass to Nickserv, Chanserv, X.
In one case by not allowing to add a user to the access list if that user has not spent
a specific amount of time in the channel room. These sudden additions to the access list are possible by sending the
AOP ADD/DEL command and Trio-Ircproxy.py will keep a copy of list before and after each addition and if they are
responsible for adding the offending users there ACCESS will be removed also, and the hive will work to keep it that way,
unless the room's Founder allows to ACCESS (limited?) the person who has caused a potential loss of the room completely,
then it will be so.
There is also quick channel SENDPASS command incase the channel password
is suspected as being leaked or shared. And a memo sent to the Founder nick to check their email
as their channel password was leaked, and the hive may have changed it (romm pass is the same as the Founder nick password?)
got that covered too. A quick password change and a private message to the Founder nick if the hostname matches. Incase any are
access is removed/added in a takeover by a Founder, Manager, Sop, or Aop, etc. If there are new Managers then you know the Founder
password has been hacked/leaked; or if the channel password has been changed. If that is the case then leave the channel until
the Founder is able to change their password via email or use the proxy hive to change the password and send a memo
to the Founder nick with the new password. If the founder nickname shares the same password as the channel the nickname
password; the nickname password will also be changed as well and emails sent with the new passwords however to prevent a flood
of emails one email pasword request per day could be triggered. You can also get the channel password by making a
Trio-Ircproxy.py powered connection to the IRC NETWORK and proving your hostname you can use the @PASS keyword and change
the channel password. To prevent leaking the password you may have Trio-Ircproxy.py manage long secure passwords by logging into
your browser and manually adding/changing passwords or, first using the password in a Trio-IrcProxy.py client proxy then
after using the `@pass` keyword will work with the
the correct service bot. Trio-IrcProxy.py will use/share your password responsibly; preventing it from
being leaked in any way possible. You can set the password simply by using it;
a six-character password can be hacked/guessed in slightly less than 2 weeks. A seven charactor password would take
months to years to crack. You can also securely share your passwords without actually letting the person view
your passwords by allowing another GetMyProxyIP.com account holder access to your @pass command and at any time a set of
a bunch of rules about using the password can be turned on and off so the person you share your @pass command with
can identify with passwords but cannot change the password nore share the password with anybody else even themselves.
It could be impossible or possible.
