This is a work in progress, if you wish to help then write issues for all and any requests. The issues is working as an to-do list of features as well as a communication channel.

Issues (requests) List :
**https://github.com/ashburry-chat-irc/trio-ircproxy/issues** 

-   Download and Install **Python 3.11** or later from
    **https://www.python.org/downloads/** it should work on Python 3.8 but I have not tested it, yet.

-   Download clink setup.exe from
    **https://github.com/chrisant996/clink/releases** and install

-   open **cmd.exe** by *right clicking* on the **Windows Start Menu** button and choose **run**

-   type in the input box **cmd.exe** and press **Enter**

-   Extract **trio-ircproxy-main.zip** by typing at the prompt
**cd %UserProfile%\Downloads**  and then **unzip trio-ircproxy-main.zip -d %UserProfile%\Documents\\** or use your favorite zip application such as 7-zip.

-   at the command prompt type **cd %UserProfile%\Documents**

-   type *dir/w* to list the files then **cd trio-ircproxy** or **cd trio-ircproxy-main**

-   type **install.bat -3.11** the *-3.11* is the *Python version* you have installed.

-   load **mIRC-Load_This_in_Remotes-INSTALL.mrc** in mirc/adiirc *remote section* and choose **YES** to *initialize script*.

Keep in mind that your **trio-ircproxy** folder may have the name
**trio-ircproxy-main**. Also the usage of **%UserProfile%** is a windows shortcut to
your home directory which is *c:\users\USER\* replace *USER* with your actual
*username*. If you do not know your username then try using **%UserProfile%** and if you have linux running you can also use **~Documents**
which will expand to your *user home folder* such as *c:\\user\\USER\\*.  If you have **OneDrive** installed then I suggest using your **Home folder** (your **%UserProfile% folder**) to hold your *trio-ircproxy* application or *uninstall* OneDrive and delete its folder if necessary.
